# File Formats of the Data Processing Pipelines Service

## Matrix Download File Format

Matrices are provided in [Loom](http://loompy.org/) file format. You can downloaded matrices through the HCA *Data Portal*. You can use the portal's Data Browser to make a multifaceted search to dynamically generate matrices or you can explore the matrices available on individual project pages.

## Working Loom Files

Loom files can be explored using multiple Python- and R-supported downstream analysis tools, including [Seurat](https://satijalab.org/seurat/), [SCANPY](https://github.com/theislab/scanpy), and [Pegasus](https://pegasus.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
