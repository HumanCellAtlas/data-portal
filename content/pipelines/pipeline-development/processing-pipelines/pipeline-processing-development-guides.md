# Pipeline Processing Development Guides

We provide pipeline development guides, described briefly below, to help you learn more about the pipeline design process and build your own single-cell data processing pipelines. 

[Best Practices for Building Data Processing Pipelines](/pipelines/pipeline-best-practices): Engineering great pipelines is a complex endeavor. We do this in an iterative manner, learning best practices as we go.

[Quick Start for Building Pipelines](/pipelines/building-pipelines): Learn about the variety of resources that have helped us with our pipeline building projects. Also, scroll down the page to find information about DCP-hosted meetings, events, and Slack channels you can join.

[Pipeline Testing Guide](/pipelines/testing-pipelines): Test whether your pipeline can execute to completion and produce the expected outputs in HCA DCP, as well as other, execution environments.
