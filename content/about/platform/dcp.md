# About the Data Coordination Platform

The Human Cell Atlas (HCA) community is profiling millions of human cells, a process that generates enormous amounts of data that scientists need to store, standardize and interpret. To help coordinate this data collection and processing, the HCA established the **Data Coordination Platform (DCP), a cloud-based platform where scientists can share, organise and interrogate single-cell data**.

The platform is operated by a dedicated team of scientists, engineers and bioinformaticians from the European Bioinformatics Institute (EBI), the Broad Institute (Broad), and the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC). 

The Data Coordination Platform is continuously developed and improved in response to researchersâ€™ needs and feedback. Learn more about providing feedback which on the [Contact](/contact) page.
  
We also encourage you to contribute your data or analysis portals and methods. Learn more on the [Contribute](/contribute) page.
